Everything that was taught during this course was all new to me! I think learning about repositories and how to host on GitHub was the coolest part about web development.

Once again, everything that we learned for web design was brand new for me! I think my favorite part about web design is using CSS to style pages, I'm stoked to see how learning Java script in the future can make my websites even cooler!

I wanted to make a website that showed my passions and describe me to my audience. After that concept, I split the html's into writings, photography, contact and an about page. Once I got the content on the pages it was about styling the page properly - which honestly the hardest thing to figure out was a photo gallery and getting the footer to work correctly. After that, it was about making sure it functioned correctly!
