My experience learning HTML has been really fun! It was completely new and even though there is still a lot more to practice, I feel like I have a good grip of it. It was difficult to learn inserting tables at first, but I got the hang of it!

I'm super excited to learn how to make images move across the web page! And how much we can decorate the web page in general.

This assignment took me a very long time. I struggled at first with a concept but once I got to Paper airplanes it became a little bit easier. Then it was just making sure things worked correctly and looked decent.
