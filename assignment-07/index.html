      <h1>Lyrics</h1>
      <p>Danny ran into some complications<br>
He falls asleep during conversations<br>
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation<br>
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation<br>
<br><br>
And all I do is sit and think about you<br>
If I knew what you'd do<br>
Collapse my veins wearing beautiful shoes<br>
It's not living if it's not with you<br>
<br><br>
And Danny says we're living in a simulation<br>
But he works in a petrol station (selling petrol)<br>
He says it all began with his operation<br>
And I know you think you're sly but you need some imagination<br>
<br><br>
And all I do is sit and think about you<br>
If I knew what you'd do<br>
Collapse my veins wearing beautiful shoes<br>
It's not living if it's not with you<br>
All I do is sit and drink without you<br>
If I choose then I lose<br>
Distract my brain from the terrible news<br>
It's not living if it's not with you<br>
<br><br>
I can't stop sweating or control my feet<br>
Got a twenty-stone monkey that I just can't beat<br>
I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat<br>
And there's a feeling, you're replacin' embracin'<br>
It's true that<br>
<br><br>
All I do is sit and think about you<br>
If I knew what you'd do<br>
Collapse my veins<br>
Wearing beautiful shoes<br>
It's not living if it's not with you<br>
<br><br>
All I do is sit and drink without you<br>
If I choose then I lose<br>
Distract my brain from the terrible news<br>
It's not living if it's not with you<br>
<br><br>
Oh, I'll try to get a job in a bank, I think<br>
Danny spent time trying to pack in the drinks for me<br>
I feel sick and I know I can't lose but<br>
It's not living if it's not with you<br>
It's not living if it's not with you, it's not, it's not<br>
It's not, it's not, It's not living if it's not with you<br>
It's not living if it's not with you, it's not, it's not<br>
It's not, it's not, it's not, it's not<br>
It's not living if it's not with you<br>
It's not, it's not<br>
It's not, it's not<br>
It's not living if it's not with you<br>
<br><br>
