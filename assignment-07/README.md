Ids attributes a unique identifier to a specific element, class groups similar types of elements together by using the same name value, divs group other elements together and can be singular or nested and spans are similar to divs but identify or group content together that requires organization or extra styling.

The alt text is what describes the image and are used by screen readers who are visually impaired.

I again started with watching the video tutorial, then going onto the website and finishing by looking through the to-do list. A issue that I keep running into that I can't seem to find the solution is my title tag not working properly. If I put it where it is in the tutorial video, the styling doesn't work. And if I move it up top before the meta elements it works but the styling still won't show up. To fix this, I put in two title elements (even though that isn't proper.)
