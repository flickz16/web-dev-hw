I've come across many forms, but generally they are for surveys on local news websites. The purpose they serve is to figure out what age you are and the best way they can use to reach you.

A example of a text is using the maxlength to limit the number of characters the user can put into the selection box. A example of selection is radio buttons, allowing the user to select one item. A example of button types is the submit type that will send a form to a server. These all could be used on a website to collect information about the user, and successfully collect the data.

My work cycle started with understanding how forms work (and I had a little trouble understanding all the inputs.) Once I got the code down, it was just trial and error on what I wanted to ask and how to make it look!
