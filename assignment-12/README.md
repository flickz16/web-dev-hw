My imaginary client was a blogger who hikes Glacier National Park often. They wanted a functional navigation bar along with colorful selections,

Inline display forces elements to act like inline elements, Inline-block removes new lines inherent in the block elements also forcing elements to respect margin and vertical spacing properties and Block display forces elements to act like block elements.

I took a while on learning how to use the navigation feature and still need to do some work before submitting my final website. After that, I read the walkthrough, looked at the example and started testing to see how far I could go. I struggled with some styling, so I went and looked at the walkthrough guide. For the final assignment I need to execute better so my website looks perfect.
