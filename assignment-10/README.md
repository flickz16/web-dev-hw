A system font are already installed on your device, a web font are custom fonts hosted on a server and a web-safe font are fonts that are already available on the system

It is important to have a fallback font because if the first font doesn't load (misspelled, etc) your text will still load.

I started by reading the website material and then moving onto the video tutorial. After that, I went with a Edgar Allen Poe short story and started messing around with the style. Then, after finding two fonts I liked I wrapped everything together for the finally product.
